Static Website
==============================

This is a simple and static website created using just one HTML file. It contains both the structure (HTML) and styling (CSS) in a single file.

ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s Happening in index.html:
----------------------------------

*   **HTML:** The page is structured using basic HTML elements like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, and `<div>`.
*   **CSS:** Styles are written directly inside the `<style>` tag within the `<head>`. This includes:

ðŸš€ How Itâ€™s Deployed:
---------------------

1.  The file `index.html` was created locally with all content and styling.
2.  The file was pushed to a GitHub repository using Git commands.
3.  GitHub Pages was enabled from the repositoryâ€™s Settings â†’ Pages section.
4.  Once GitHub Pages is enabled, the website becomes publicly accessible at:  
    `https://trivediayush.github.io/Static-Website`
